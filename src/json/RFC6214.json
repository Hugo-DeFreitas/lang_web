Since the minimum link MTU allowed by <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2460\">RFC 2460</a> is 1280 octets, this means that older carriers MUST be used for IPv6.  <a data-document_source_json_name=\"RFC1149\" class=\"change-document-trigger\">RFC 1149</a> does not provide exact conversion factors between age and milligrams, or between milligrams and octets.  These conversion factors are implementation dependent, but as an illustrative example, we assume that the 256 milligram MTU suggested in <a data-document_source_json_name=\"RFC1149\" class=\"change-document-trigger\">RFC 1149</a> corresponds to an MTU of 576 octets.  In that case, the typical MTU for the present specification will be at least 256*1280/576, which is approximately 569 milligrams.  Again as an illustrative example, this is likely to require a carrier age of at least 365 days.</p><p>Furthermore, the MTU issues are non-linear with carrier age. That is, a young carrier can only carry small payloads, an adult carrier can carry jumbograms [<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2675\">RFC2675</a>], and an elderly carrier can again carry only smaller payloads.  There is also an effect on transit time depending on carrier age, affecting bandwidth-delay product and hence the performance of <abbr title=\"Transmission control protocol\">TCP</abbr>.</p>"

Indeed, header snaps are known to worsen the quality of service provided by <a data-document_source_json_name=\"RFC1149\" class=\"change-document-trigger\">RFC 1149</a> carriers.  In the interests of efficiency and to avoid excessive energy consumption while packets are in flight through the network, no such link layer tag is required for IPv6 packets either.</p><p>The frame format is therefore a pure IPv6 packet as defined in [<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2460\">RFC2460</a>], encoded and decoded as defined in [<a data-document_source_json_name=\"RFC1149\" class=\"change-document-trigger\">RFC1149</a>].</p>\n"

IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861\">RFC4861</a>] is therefore impossible.<p><p>Implementations SHOULD NOT even try to use stateless address auto-configuration [<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4862\">RFC4862</a>].  This recommendation is because this mechanism requires a stable interface identifier formed in a way compatible with [<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291\">RFC4291</a>].  Unfortunately the transmission elements specified by <a data-document_source_json_name=\"RFC1149\" class=\"change-document-trigger\">RFC 1149</a> are not generally stable enough for this and may become highly unstable in the presence of a cross-wind.</p><p>In most deployments, either the end points of the link remain unnumbered, or a /127 prefix and static addresses MAY be assigned.

IPv6 packets carrying a non-default <abbr title=\"Differentiated Services Code Point\">DSCP</abbr> value in their Traffic Class field [<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2460\">RFC2450</a>] MUST be specially encoded using green or blue ink such that the DSCP is externally visible.  Note that red ink MUST NOT be used to avoid confusion with the usage of red paint specified in <a data-document_source_json_name=\"RFC2549\" class=\"change-document-trigger\">RFC 2549</a>.</p><p><a data-document_source_json_name=\"RFC2549\" class=\"change-document-trigger\">RFC 2549</a> did not consider the impact on quality of service of different types of carriers.  There is a broad range.  Some are very fast but can only carry small payloads and transit short distances, others are slower but carry large payloads and transit very large distances.  It may be appropriate to select the individual carrier for a packet on the basis of its DSCP value.  Indeed, different carriers will implement different per-hop behaviors according to <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2474\">RFC 2474</a>.</p>"

Similarly, routing carriers through the territory of predatory carriers may potentially cause severe packet loss.  It is strongly recommended that these factors be considered in the routing algorithm used to create carrier routing tables.  Implementers should consider policy-based routing to ensure reliable packet delivery by routing around areas where territorial and predatory carriers are prevalent.<p><p>There is evidence that some carriers have a propensity to eat other carriers and then carry the eaten payloads.  Perhaps this provides a new way to tunnel an IPv4 packet in an IPv6 payload, or vice versa.</p><p>However, the decapsulation mechanism is unclear at the time of this writing.</p>"

In addition, recent experience suggests that the transmission elements are exposed to many different forms of denial-of-service attacks, especially when perching.  Also, the absence of link layer identifiers referred to above, combined with the lack of checksums in the IPv6 header, basically means that any transmission element could be mistaken for any other, with no means of detecting the substitution at the network layer.  The use of an upper-layer security mechanism of some kind seems like a really good idea.</p><p>There is a known risk of infection by the so-called H5N1 virus.
